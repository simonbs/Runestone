### üëã Welcome to Runestone - a performant plain text editor for iOS with code editing features

Runestone uses GitHub's [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) to parse code to a syntax tree which is used for features that require an understanding of the code in the editor, for example syntax highlighting.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Sponsors Only (Until May 5th)

This repository is currently only available to people who are sponsoring my work on GitHub. The repository will be made available to everyone on May 5th.

I've decided to give people sponsoring me a sneak peek of Runestone, since I know there are a few people amongst my sponsors who have been patiently awaiting Runestone for the past few months, and it's time that you get a chance to check it out. Please don't share the contents of this repository with anyone else for the time being.

I'm also hoping that you'll give me some early feedback on the project, so I can smooth out any issues. Please don't hesitate to to create issues if you stumble upon any bugs or shortcomings üòä

## ‚ú® Features

- Syntax highlighting.
- Line numbers.
- Highlight the selected line.
- Show invisible characters (tabs, spaces and line breaks).
- Insertion of character pairs, e.g. inserting the trailing quotation mark when inserting the leading.
- Customization of colors and fonts.
- Toggle line wrapping on and off.
- Adjust height of lines.
- Add a page guide.
- Add vertical and horizontal overscroll.
- Highlight ranges in the text view.
- Search the text using regular expressions.
- Automatically detects if a file is using spaces or tabs for indentation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Please refer to the [Getting Started](https://docs.runestone.app/documentation/runestone/gettingstarted) article in the documentation.

## üìñ Documentation

The documentation os all public types is available at [docs.runestone.app](https://docs.runestone.app). The documentation is generated from the Swift code using Apple's [DocC documentation compiler](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc).

## üèé Performance

Runestone was built to be fast. It's good performance is by far mostly thanks to Tree-sitter's incremental parsing and [AvalonEdit's approach for managing lines in a document](https://github.com/icsharpcode/AvalonEdit/blob/master/ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit/Document/DocumentLineTree.cs).

When judging the performance of Runestone, it is key to build your app in the release configuration. The optimizations applied by the compiler when using the release configuration becomes very apparent when opening large documents.

## üì± Projects

The Runestone framework is used by an app of the same name. Runestone (the app) is a plain text editor for iPhone and iPad that uses all the features of this framework.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Acknowledgments

- [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter) is used to parse code incrementally.
- Line management is translated to Swift from [AvalonEdit](https://github.com/icsharpcode/AvalonEdit).
- [swift-tree-sitter](https://github.com/viktorstrate/swift-tree-sitter) and [SwiftTreeSitter](https://github.com/ChimeHQ/SwiftTreeSitter) which have served as inspiration for the Tree-sitter bindings.
- Detection of indent strategy inspired by [auto-detect-indentation](https://github.com/jtokoph/auto-detect-indentation).
- And last (but not least!), thanks a ton to [Alexander Blach](https://twitter.com/Lextar) (developer of [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com)), [Till Konitzer](https://twitter.com/knutknatter) (developer of [Essayist](https://www.essayist.app)), [Greg Pierce](https://twitter.com/agiletortoise) (developer of [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com)) and [Max Brunsfeld](https://twitter.com/maxbrunsfeld) (developer of [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/)) for pointing me in the right direction when I got stuck.
